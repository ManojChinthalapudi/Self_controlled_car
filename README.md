# Self_controlled_car
The implementation of autonomous cars in India can address several critical needs and challenges in the country’s transportation system.
Autonomous cars can play a crucial role in optimizing traffic management by leveraging real-time data, predictive analytics, and intelligent routing algorithms. Through communication with other autonomous vehicles and traffic infrastructure, these cars can actively avoid congestion, select the most efficient routes, and coordinate their movements.
